# Task Plan: Fix Navbar Height to Fit Logo Professionally

## Problem Analysis
Based on the logo position screenshot:
- Logo is now properly sized (h-32 = 128px)
- Navbar height is too tall with excessive vertical padding
- "Sign in" and "Sign up" buttons look lost in the white space
- Overall appearance is unprofessional due to poor proportions

## Root Cause
The navbar container (`py-4`) has too much padding for the large logo size.

## Plan Checklist

### Phase 1: Adjust Navbar Proportions
- [x] Reduce navbar vertical padding from `py-4` to `py-2`
- [x] Ensure logo and buttons are properly aligned vertically
- [x] Make navbar height proportional to logo size

### Phase 2: Optimize Button Sizing
- [x] Adjust button padding to look proportional with new navbar height (`py-3` instead of `py-2`)
- [x] Ensure buttons align nicely with the logo (increased `px-6` and `px-8`)
- [x] Maintain professional spacing between elements (`space-x-4`)

### Phase 3: Validation
- [x] Check that navbar looks professional and balanced
- [x] Verify responsive behavior is maintained
- [x] Ensure proper visual hierarchy
